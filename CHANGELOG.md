# Changelog

All notable changes to ИСПУМ. Newest first. Dates are when the change **shipped to
production**. Work that's built but not yet deployed lives under **[Unreleased]**.

This is the *internal* engineering log. The user-facing, curated changelog is the
public **Обновления платформы** page (`frontend/src/pages/Changelog.tsx`) — promote
highlights there when you want users to know.

Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com): grouped into
**Added / Changed / Fixed**.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Topic generator** — AI suggests research/practical topics from student level, field,
  interests, and practice site, calibrated to ФГОС level requirements. Yandex Search
  grounding (best-effort, degrades to model-only). Free: 3/mo, Pro/Institution: unlimited.
- Institution entitlement inheritance — active members inherit their institution's tier (full access) automatically
- Institution-shared rubrics now appear in every member's grading rubric picker (`is_institution_shared`)
- Bulk teacher invite (paste a list of emails)
- Institution audit log (admin actions) + panel page
- Email-domain auto-join (teachers with a matching domain auto-join the institution; admin-set domain)
- Moodle-compatible CSV grade export (Журнал)
- Institution CSV usage export (units only)
- Compliance collateral: `docs/legal/security-overview.md`, `docs/legal/152-fz-dpa.md`
- `FEATURES.md` feature inventory + `CHANGELOG.md`

### Changed
- Brand expansion — full name «ИСПУМ — Интеллектуальная Система Проверки и Подготовки Учебных Материалов»
  now appears on landing hero (amber kicker), login & register subtitles, public footer,
  header logo tooltip, HTML meta description, and PWA manifest description.
- Auth pages (Login / Register / ForgotPassword / ResetPassword) — clickable logo + explicit
  «На главную» link so direct-arrivals can navigate back to the marketing site.
- Landing hero rewritten — «Преподавание без компромиссов» framing (tighter, sets up the
  three feature sections as compromises eliminated).
- Pricing pages refreshed (Landing tariffs section + Pricing.tsx kept in sync):
  - Free tier — added topic generator limit + 30-day history line
  - Pro tier — added ВКР review, calculation grading, topics, Moodle CSV export
  - **Institution tier price changed to «Индивидуально / По запросу»** for negotiation
    flexibility; expanded feature list (bulk invite, domain auto-join, audit log, 152-ФЗ DPA)
  - Institution CTA now correctly links to /contact (was /register / /institutions)
  - Comparison table — 7 new rows (Topics, ВКР review, STEM, Moodle CSV, domain auto-join,
    audit log, 152-ФЗ DPA)
- `/institutions` page rewritten — 9 sections (hero, pain points, 6 feature blocks, ВКР showcase,
  decision-maker breakdown by role, security & infra, ROI, procurement FAQ, final CTA) that
  cover every institutional feature we've built and address декан / IT / методический отдел each.
- `/about` page rewritten — turned from a feature-repeat-of-Landing into a manifesto-style
  About: manifesto hero, origin story, 4-principle «во что мы верим» block, analytics-philosophy
  feature, modest team paragraph, calm CTA.
- Scaling pass for 1000-user readiness:
  - PG pool `max=25` + query/connection timeouts (`backend/src/db/connection.ts`); new env `DB_POOL_MAX`
  - Migration 016 — composite + partial indexes on `assignments` for the Журнал query
  - PM2 cluster mode (`instances: 2`, `exec_mode: 'cluster'`)
  - Scheduler gated to PM2 worker 0 only (renewals.ts) so cluster mode doesn't fire it twice
  - VM ops checklist (`docs/ops/vm-tuning.md`): Postgres tuning for 2 GB, pm2-logrotate, cluster restart
  - Scaling roadmap (`docs/scaling.md`): Tier 1 (done) / Tier 2 (when needed) / Tier 3 (architectural)
- Confirmation screens — replaced platform-dependent OS emojis (✅/✉️/🙏/🎉) with a single
  brand-aligned `SuccessMark` SVG component (success-tinted circle + checkmark). Applied to
  ResetPassword, ForgotPassword, Feedback, and PaymentResult (amber tone for the celebration).
- Topic generator — generated topics can now be attached to a specific student (optional
  name + group fields with autocomplete from existing students). Migration 017 adds
  `student_name`/`student_group` columns to `topic_sets` + a partial index for lookup.
  History cards show «… · для {имя} · {группа}» when present. Student fields are stored
  for organisation only — not sent to the AI prompt (the model still uses field/interests/site
  to drive topic quality).
- Grading scale switched A–F → Russian 5-point (5/4/3/2) everywhere: prompts, validation,
  UI, colours. Existing grades migrated (014). Grade colour/label centralized in `frontend/src/lib/grades.ts`.
- Rubric builder simplified — removed redundant МАКС field; weights are now percentages with a live sum-to-100 check
- Landing page copy + new analytics feature pillar
- Public changelog page refreshed with real shipped features + correct dates (1.0–1.3)

### Fixed
- Institution panel: shows a friendly pointer instead of 400 console errors when the
  signed-in admin has no institution (platform-admin edge case). `institution_id` now
  returned on login + `/me`.

## [2026-06-05]

### Added
- Long-document review (ВКР/диплом) — section-aware map-reduce: chapter analysis, defense questions, suggested grade
- STEM / calculation grading — reasoning model + optional reference solution + STEM rubric templates
- Журнал (grading history) — search, filters, pagination; revisit any past grade/review (detail modal)
- Onboarding — welcome modal, getting-started checklist, per-page intros, no-course hints
- In-app feedback (page → email + DB + admin view)
- Help center
- Institution panel (overview, usage, teachers, rubrics) + invite flow + accept-on-register
- Platform-admin institution management (create/edit, assign admins/teachers)
- Email via Unisender Go (transactional) + owner notifications (signup, purchase, feedback)
- Course document upload on creation; teacher rubric builder; student groups + Students page

### Changed
- `PlanSync` — app reconciles plan with the server on load (no more stale free-tier display)
- Bigger, clearer logout button; amber-accented feedback nav link

### Fixed
- Stale plan display after upgrade (PlanSync)
- Single-pass grading cap raised; long works routed to review pipeline
